== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does automation, trigger and action means? =

Automations are the basic building block of AutomatorWP and they have 2 main parts: triggers and actions.

Triggers are the part that determines when an automation will run a perform it's actions. Triggers are known as "When this happens".

Actions are the part that determines what an automation will perform after all it's triggers gets completed. Actions are known as "Do this".

You can setup an automation like this:
Trigger: When user visits a post.
Action: Send email to the user.

= Where can I find all available triggers, actions and filters? =

Check [this page](https://automatorwp.com/all-triggers-and-actions/) where you can find all available triggers, actions and filters from all our add-ons.

= Where can I find documentation about AutomatorWP? =

Check the [official documentation](https://automatorwp.com/docs/) where you can start getting familiarized with AutomatorWP.

= Can AutomatorWP connect plugins with external services like Zapier? =

Yes, is completely possible thanks to the [Webhooks](https://automatorwp.com/add-ons/webhooks/) add-on that lets you connect all your plugins with external applications, web services or even others WordPress sites.

= Can AutomatorWP connect plugins from different sites? =

Yes, with the [Webhooks](https://automatorwp.com/add-ons/webhooks/) add-on you connect your plugins from a site to the plugins from another site.

You can create brand new automations between different sites like:

When user publishes a post of a specific category on Site A, Clone this post on Site B.

= What if I deactivate or remove a plugin that includes new triggers and actions? =

The most recommended is remove first all triggers and actions from this plugin in order to ensure the correct workflow of AutomatorWP, because automations with triggers from this plugin can no longer be completed.

= Will AutomatorWP slow down my website? =

This depends heavily on how you use AutomatorWP.

You shouldn't notice any performance impact while using AutomatorWP but, if you have dozens of automations, thousands of users, and your automations are configured with many triggers and actions, then yes, there could be a performance hit.

Try to configure automations only for real needs, for example, we discourage using AutomatorWP as an analytics tool (setting up automations to track page visits).

= Is AutomatorWP compatible with any theme? =

Yes, AutomatorWP doesn't includes any frontend feature, everything is configure at the WordPress backend, so AutomatorWP doesn't requires compatibility with any theme.

Yes, AutomatorWP is stored in the official WordPress plugins repository where you (and anyone) are able to [submit your own translations](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/automatorwp).

= Do you offer custom development services? =

No, We're unable to provide custom development services, as our focus is developing the core AutomatorWP plugin, and the official AutomatorWP add-ons.
