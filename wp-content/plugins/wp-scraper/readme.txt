This Wordpress Scraper allows you to move a non-Wordpress
website into a Wordpress site.

== Description ==

= Migrating A Website Has Never Been Easier =

Easily copy pages of content with images from your old website and create your own Wordpress pages and posts. 

Most of the web migration software available is hard to use and needs advanced knowledge. WP Scraper makes it simple with an easy to use visual interface on your WordPress site.

In this version, the Single Scraper is fully functional and the Multiple Scraper is limited to ten posts at a time.

* Visual interface for selecting content.
* No need to know CSS selectors.
* Images are imported to your media library.
* Simply add your url and start grabbing content.
* Automatically populate the featured image, title, tags, and categories.
* Save as draft, post, or page.
* Strip unwanted css, iframes, and/or videos from content
* Remove links from the content.
* Post to a selected category.

The WP Scraper Pro version allows unlimited posts and pages with the Multiple Scrape. The Pro version is also packed with extra features to remove ads during import, filter content, and even an upgraded url selection. Please visit http://www.wpscraper.com/ for more information.

The WP Live Scraper Pro has a fully functional Live Scrape feature that allows automatically refreshed content for ratings, reviews, scores, rankings and so much more! Please visit http://www.wplivescraper.com/ for more information.
